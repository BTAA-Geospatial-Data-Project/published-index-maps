# Published Index Maps
This repository stores all **finished Index Maps** that are used to display on [BTAA Geoportal](https://geo.btaa.org). All Index Maps follow the [OpenIndexMaps](https://openindexmaps.org) format. However, for users who want to check the **python scripts** or **CSV files** for these Index Maps, you can visit this [Repository](https://github.com/geobtaa/create-indexmaps) for more information.


Each folder contains one or multiple index maps that belong to the same **Code**. Here we provide quick links below to edit the OpenIndexMap Reference Link on GEOMG and also check the map displaying on Big Ten portal. While linking the Index Map on GEOMG, make sure you are using the **raw file url**.
